# ADAS Architecture

This directory contains the system-level flowchart and architecture diagrams for the ADAS system, showing the integration of various sensors (camera, radar/LIDAR) and machine learning models.

The architecture illustrates how data flows from sensors through preprocessing, object detection, sensor fusion, and decision-making components to enable collision avoidance and other ADAS features.
